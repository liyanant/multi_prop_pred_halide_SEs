# Optimised K_VRH and G_VRH regressor models

## Key information
The optimised models prepared can be used directly for the model training step. Most of the models can be loaded using pycaret's `load_model` function. For the Skorch Neural Networks, the model architecture needs to be defined and initialised first before the model can be loaded. Users may refer to the The model architectures were inspired from those shown in this website: https://coderzcolumn.com/tutorials/artificial-intelligence/skorch-give-scikit-learn-like-api-to-your-pytorch-networks

# Optimised K_VRH and G_VRH regressor models

## Key information
The optimised models prepared can be used directly for the model training step. Most of the models can be loaded using pycaret's `load_model` function. For the Skorch Neural Networks, the model architecture needs to be defined and initialised first before the model can be loaded. Users may use the `mechanical_properties/codes/K_VRH_and_G_VRH_Skorch_NN_optimised_hyperparameters_for_model_loading.ipynb` code to do so. The model architectures were also inspired from those shown in this website: https://coderzcolumn.com/tutorials/artificial-intelligence/skorch-give-scikit-learn-like-api-to-your-pytorch-networks

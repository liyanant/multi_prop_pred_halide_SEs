# ESW predictions

The ESW of an SE is defined as the difference between the its oxidation and reduction potentials. ESW predictions in this work were performed via predictions of the reduction and oxidation potentials. The predictions of both potentials were performed using the regression method. The training dataset is adapted from Wang et al. and contains 1502 materials from the ICSD<sup>1,2</sup>. The validation dataset contains materials that contain any of the 7 elements with the most negative standard reduction potentials (Li, Na, K, Ca, Mg, Al, Ba)<sup>3</sup>.

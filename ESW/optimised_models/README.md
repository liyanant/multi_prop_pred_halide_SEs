# Optimised K_VRH and G_VRH regressor models

## Key information
The optimised models prepared can be used directly for the model training step. Most of the models can be loaded using pycaret's `load_model` function. For the Skorch Neural Networks, the model architecture needs to be defined and initialised first before the model can be loaded.
